# Machine Learning for Dementia
Detection of Dementia using Machine Learning and Python 

Introduction & Rationale: 
Neurological disorders like Alzheimer’s and Dementia pose major public health threats, as identified by the WHO. Understanding brain function and changes is crucial for uncovering the mechanisms behind these disorders. Traditional methods involve hypothesis-driven, bottom-up approaches, but a data-driven approach is also essential for understanding the brain’s complexity. Recent successes in Deep Learning (DL) for Computer Vision suggest it could also be effective for analyzing high-dimensional neuroimaging data. This project aims to develop a DL framework for identifying biomarkers from neuroimaging data to enhance our understanding of neurological disorders and support intervention strategies.

Methods: EEG data from 59 Alzheimer’s patients, 7 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and 102 controls was analyzed. Signal complexity and temporal dynamics of transient events across wideband data (0-50 Hz) were computed using the Hidden Markov Model (HMM). The features extracted by the HMM model were used to train a Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet) for differentiating between disease stages and classifying between healthy and patient populations. In future work, new data will be collected with the Muse EEG Device, and the analysis will be repeated to investigate the reproducibility of the model.
